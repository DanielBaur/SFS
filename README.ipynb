    "Signal Formation Simulation (SFS) is a Python (Python3) script meant process (arbitrary/MC/WIMP/etc...) recoil spectra (i.e. either generated manually or via MC simulations) into the S1/S2 signature within a LXe TPC detector such as DARWIN (in PE/phd) utilizing NEST (NESTv2.0.1). It consists of three main components:\n",

    "* Signal Formation (SF.py): main code, process specified spectra within a specified detector using NEST\n",

    "NEST (Noble Element Simulation Technique) is a simulation tool for scintillation, ionization and electroluminescence processes. Its main applications are various simulation capabilities for experimental dark matter searches. The working principle is based on parameterizing expressions for physical quantities (e.g. charge yield, relative scintillation efficiency, etcg.) based on current experimental results. The code is written in C++ and maintained by the NEST collaboration (see: [--> the official NEST website <--](http://nest.physics.ucdavis.edu/)). SFS is essentially a framework so NEST can be used to automatically process arbitrary recoil spectra.\n",

    "1. First create a new directory and within that git clone the repository:<br>`$ git clone https://personal_username@github.com/NESTCollaboration/nest.git`\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Then create the `build` and `install` directories - but make sure they are on the same level as the `nest` directory. I.e. from within the git cloned `nest` directory execute:<br>`$ mkdir ../build; mkdir ../install; cd ../build`\n",
    "\n",
    "3. From within the 'build' directory configure cmake:<br>`$ cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=./../install ../nest`\n",
